# Greedy

Created: August 26, 2021 3:02 PM

A greedy algorithm, as the name suggests, always makes the choice that seems to be the best at that moment. This means that it makes a locally-optimal choice in the hope that this choice will lead to a globally-optimal solution.

**Where to use Greedy algorithms?**

A problem must comprise these two components for a greedy algorithm to work:

1. It has **optimal substructures**. The optimal solution for the problem contains optimal solutions to the sub-problems.
2. It has a **greedy property** (hard to prove its
correctness!). If you make a choice that seems the best at the moment
and solve the remaining sub-problems later, you still reach an optimal
solution. You will never have to reconsider your earlier choices.
